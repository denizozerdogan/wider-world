                <p>Throughout history women have been in constant struggle, not only to be respected and valued as members of society, but also to achieve equal rights and opportunities. 
                    When we think of icons of feminism, names like Ada Lovelace, Marie Curie, Frida Kahlo, Malala Yousafzai, among others, usually come to mind. 
                    Today we propose that you travel in time and meet the women who made history by putting themselves forward in achieving these goals. 
                    <br>In this package, our journey will begin with traveling to England in 1908 to witness Emmeline Pankhurst with her speech "The Plight of Women" demanding the right to vote for all women. 
                    Then we will jump forward to watch Queen Elizabeth during her coronation in 1953 which was historic, not only because it was broadcasted on television, 
                    but also because she was the first woman in the line of succession to become one of the most powerful women in society and world politics. 
                    Finally, we will conclude our journey in Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, where in 1963 Valentina Tereshkova as the only crew member was successfully launched into space, being able to circle the earth 48 times for almost 3 days. 
                    <br>This temporal trip makes us think about the role we have as women in this society, but above all it makes us reflect: even if we are not queens, astronauts, actresses, artists or scientists, 
                    we can question the structures of patriarchy that we are still tearing down thanks to the tireless struggle of many women who came before us. 
                    This pack is not only a journey, but also an invitation to fight for our rights and opportunities.
