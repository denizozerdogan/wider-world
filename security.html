                Time travel can seem like a great adventure, but also can be a little worrying! 
                Wider World has you covered with in-place security measures so that you can relax and enjoy your time traveling, meeting your icons and witnessing history first-hand. 
                Our security measures include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>PSP certified guide that takes you through the three-day experience from start to finish;</li>
                <li>Safety tags with emergency buttons and built-in location trackers so that you can reach us out whenever you need;</li>
                <li>Pre-departure orientation that walks you through the entire experience, with explanations of codes of conduct, what to expect and a security briefing.</li>
                <li>Travel bags with everything you need provided, including change of clothes, basic toiletries, and a map of our travel zone with our time portal marked on the map, with detailed explanations as to how to get there if you need! You only need to bring yourself!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You might be asking yourself, “I am traveling through time, what if I accidentally do something that changes the course of time?!”, do not fret! 
                Our time travel portals open into time bubbles, meaning these events are isolated in that time and space, and do not follow a linear timeline. 
                So you can enjoy your day with Marie Curie and tell her about the future as much as you want!
