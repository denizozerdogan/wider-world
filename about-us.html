                Hello! <br> We are Wider World by Lovelace, a travel agency founded and managed solely by women with the purpose of offering people a unique experience, by enabling them to live historical events of the past and enjoy them from the present.
                <br>We offer an unforgettable experience to our guests, reliving historical events that have marked a before and after in society that we would surely have liked to witness and experience with all our senses.
                <br>The idea of the travel agency was born after a dinner with friends, who after a few glasses of wine began to talk about the possibility of time travel. YES! An idea straight out of a movie. We began to look for scientists and researchers who have been able to patent a portal that allows us to travel. We have been living our dream and reliving history with our customers since 2023.Â
